# (Optional) Configure a third-party TLS certificate

Platform.sh automatically provides standard TLS certificates issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to all production instances. No further action is required to use TLS-encrypted connections beyond [specifying HTTPS routes](/configuration/routes.md#HTTPS) in your `routes.yaml` file.

Alternatively, you may provide your own third party TLS certificate from the TLS issuer of your choice at no charge from us.  Please consult your TLS issuer for instructions on how to generate an TLS certificate.

A custom certificate is not necessary for development environments.  Platform.sh automatically provides wildcard certificates that cover all \*.platform.sh domains, including development environments.

> **note**
> The private key should be in the old style, which means it should start with BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY. If it starts with BEGIN PRIVATE KEY that means it is bundled with the identifier for key type. To convert it to the old-style RSA key:
> `openTLS rsa -in private.key -out private.rsa.key`

### Adding a custom certificate through the web interface

You can add a custom certificate via the Platform.sh [Web Interface](/administration/web.md). Just go to the [project configuration page](/administration/web/configure-project.md) in the web interface and click on Certificates. You can then add your private key, public key certificate and optional certificate chain.

### Adding a custom certificate through the CLI

Example:
```bash
platform domain:add secure.example.com --cert=/etc/TLS/private/secure-example-com.crt --key=/etc/TLS/private/secure-example-com.key
```

See `platform help domain:add` for more information.
